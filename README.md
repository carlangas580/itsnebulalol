### About me

I'm Nebula, a developer from the United States. I started projects such as [palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n) and [Permasigner](https://github.com/permasigner/permasigner). My favorite programming languages are Python and Typescript. I am learning how to build iOS apps with SwiftUI.

I'm currently working on [Nocturne](https://github.com/usenocturne), a custom firmware for the discontinued Spotify Car Thing.
